# This shell script is a simple script to export environmental variables that your docker-compose.yml can read.
# These environment variables are also accessible when other apps start through their docker-compose.yml files.
# Most applications will not require this feature.

# If we (for example) wanted to share BTC RPC Explorer's Address API with other apps; that would look like this:
#export APP_BTC_RPC_EXPLORER_ADDRESS_API="electrumx"
